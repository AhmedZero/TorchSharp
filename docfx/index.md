Then, start by reading up on [creating your own modules](articles/modules.md).

## Tips and Tricks

[Some thoughts](articles/memory.md) on how to manage memory well in your TorchSharp training code.

Instructions on how to [share model weights](articles/saveload.md) between applications, whether in Python or .NET.

Loading existing TorchScript files is now supported and described in [Loading TorchScript](articles/torchscript.md).
